# ✂️ Image Resizer Desktop App 
This is a practice project I worked on to get a brief understanding of Electron js. 
In this desktop app, You can crop an image you have saved in your local folders. 
# ✨Features:
- You can add a file to be cropped and at the time, you can see the current dimensions of the image.
- In the width and height input fields, you can give the dimensions to which you need the image to be cropped.
